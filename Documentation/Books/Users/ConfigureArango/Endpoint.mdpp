!CHAPTER JavaScript Interface for managing Endpoints

The ArangoDB server can listen for incoming requests on multiple *endpoints*.

The endpoints are normally specified either in ArangoDB's configuration file or on
the command-line, using the ["--server.endpoint"](../ConfigureArango/Arangod.md) option.
The default endpoint for ArangoDB is *tcp://127.0.0.1:8529* or *tcp://localhost:8529*.

The number of endpoints can also be changed at runtime using the API described
below. Each endpoint can optionally be restricted to a specific list of databases
only, thus allowing the usage of different port numbers for different databases.  

This may be useful in multi-tenant setups. 
A multi-endpoint setup may also be useful to turn on encrypted communication for
just specific databases.

The JavaScript interface for endpoints provides operations to add new endpoints at 
runtime, and optionally restrict them for use with specific databases. The interface 
also can be used to update existing endpoints or remove them at runtime.

Please note that all endpoint management operations can only be accessed via
the default database (*_system*) and none of the other databases.

When not in the default database, you must first switch to it using the 
*db._useDatabase* method.
