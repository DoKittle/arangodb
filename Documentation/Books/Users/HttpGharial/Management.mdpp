!CHAPTER Manage your graphs

The graph module provides functions dealing with graph structures.

!SUBSECTION First Steps with Graphs

A Graph consists of *vertices* and *edges*. Edges are stored as documents in *edge
collections*. A vertex can be a document of a *document collection* or of an edge
collection (so edges can be used as vertices). Which collections are used within
a graph is defined via *edge definitions*. A graph can contain more than one edge
definition, at least one is needed.

@brief Lists all graphs known to the graph module.

@RESTHEADER{GET /_api/gharial, List all graphs}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
Lists all graph names stored in this database.ssss

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{200}

@brief Create a new graph in the graph module.

@RESTHEADER{POST /_api/gharial, Create a graph}

@RESTDESCRIPTION
The creation of a graph requires the name of the graph and a definition of its edges.

@RESTBODYPARAMS

@RESTPARAM{name, string, required}
Name of the graph.

@RESTPARAM{edgeDefinitions, string, optional}
An array of definitions for the edges, see [edge definitions](../General-Graphs/Management.md#edge_definitions).

@RESTPARAM{orphanCollections, string, optional}

@RESTRETURNCODES

@RESTRETURNCODE{201}
Is returned if the graph could be created.
The body contains the graph configuration that has been stored.

@RESTRETURNCODE{409}
Returned if there is a conflict storing the graph.
This can occur either if a graph with this name is already stored, or if there is one edge definition with a the same [edge collection](../Glossary/index.html#edge_collection) but a different signature used in any other graph.
